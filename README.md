## Introduction

Lux is a modern systems programming language designed to provide the performance and control of low-level languages while maintaining developer productivity and code clarity. Built from the ground up to address common pain points in systems programming.

## Why?

Modern systems programming often involves a trade-off between performance, safety, and developer experience. Lux aims to bridge this gap by providing:

- **Direct hardware access** without sacrificing code readability
- **Predictable performance** characteristics for systems-critical applications  
- **Developer-friendly tooling** that doesn't compromise on compile speed
- **Memory safety options** that can be opted into when needed

## Language Goals

- **üéØ Minimal & Explicit Syntax** ‚Äì Avoid hidden control flow or magic
- **‚ö° Fast Compilation** ‚Äì Prioritize developer feedback cycles
- **üöÄ Zero-Cost Abstractions** ‚Äì Avoid performance penalties for convenience
- **üîß Manual Memory Control** ‚Äì Support fine-grained memory management
- **üõ†Ô∏è Toolchain Simplicity** ‚Äì No complex build systems required

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Early Development

Lux is currently in active development. Core language features are being implemented and the compiler architecture is being established. 
Check out the [todo](todo) to see what is being worked on or that is done.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following tools installed:

- **[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)** - Build automation
- **[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)** - GNU Compiler Collection
- **[LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)** - Compiler infrastructure
- **[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/)** *(optional)* - Memory debugging
