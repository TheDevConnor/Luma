## Introduction

Luma is a modern systems programming language designed to provide the performance and control of low-level languages while maintaining developer productivity and code clarity.  
It's built from the ground up to address common pain points in systems programming ‚Äî offering explicit memory control, compile-time verification, and minimal abstraction overhead.

Luma uses **manual memory management with static analysis**, giving developers full control over when and how memory is allocated or freed, while the type checker verifies correctness before code generation.

---

## Why?

Modern systems programming often involves a trade-off between performance, safety, and developer experience.  
Luma aims to bridge that gap by providing:

- **Manual memory control** with **compile-time static analysis**  
  ‚Äî The type checker validates use-after-free, double-free, and unfreed allocations before codegen.
- **Blazing fast compilation** ‚Äî 50ms for a complete 3D graphics application
- **Tiny binaries** ‚Äî 24KB stripped executables (comparable to C)
- **Direct hardware access** and predictable performance  
- **Readable, minimal syntax** that doesn't hide control flow or introduce lifetimes
- **Zero runtime overhead** ‚Äî all verification is done statically
- **Fast, transparent tooling** that stays close to the metal

Unlike Rust, Luma doesn't use lifetimes or a borrow checker. Instead, developers can annotate functions with lightweight ownership hints like `#returns_ownership` and `#takes_ownership` so the analyzer can reason about ownership transfers ‚Äî for example, when returning an allocated pointer.

The result: **C-level control with static guarantees**, and no runtime or hidden semantics.

---

## Performance

Luma is designed for **speed at every stage** ‚Äî from compilation to execution:

### Compilation Speed

```bash
# 3D graphics application with 4 standard libraries
$ luma 3d_spinning_cube.lx -l math.lx memory.lx string.lx termfx.lx
[========================================] 100% - Completed (51ms)
Build succeeded! Written to '3d_test' (51ms)
```

**Real-world metrics:**

- **51ms**: Complete 3D graphics app with math, memory management, strings, and terminal effects
- **+1ms**: Memory safety analysis overhead (essentially free)
- **Sub-100ms**: Typical compilation times for most projects

### Binary Size

```bash
$ ls -lh 3d_test_stripped
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 24K Oct 9 19:27 3d_test_stripped
```

**Comparable to C** ‚Äî Luma produces tiny, efficient binaries:

- **24KB**: Stripped 3D graphics application
- **29KB**: With debug symbols
- **Zero runtime**: No garbage collector, no hidden allocations

### Comparison Table

| Language | Compile Time Range | Your Test | Binary Size |
|----------|--------------------|-----------|-------------|
| C/C++    | 100-800ms          | ~300ms    | 40-80KB     |
| Rust     | 2-15s              | ~3-5s     | 150-400KB   |
| Go       | 100-400ms          | ~200ms    | 1.5-2MB     |
| Zig      | 200-600ms          | ~400ms    | 30-50KB     |
| **Luma** | **50-52ms**        | **51ms**  | **24KB**    |

## Language Goals

- **üéØ Minimal & Explicit Syntax** ‚Äì No hidden control flow or implicit behavior  
- **‚ö° Lightning-Fast Compilation** ‚Äì Sub-100ms builds for rapid iteration  
- **üöÄ Zero-Cost Abstractions** ‚Äì No runtime overhead for safety or ergonomics  
- **üì¶ Tiny Binaries** ‚Äì Comparable to C in size and efficiency  
- **üîß Manual Memory Control** ‚Äì You decide when to `alloc()` and `free()`  
- **üß† Static Verification** ‚Äì The type checker validates memory safety (use-after-free, double-free, leaks) before codegen  
- **üîç Optional Ownership Annotations** ‚Äì Use `#returns_ownership` and `#takes_ownership` to make ownership transfer explicit  

---

## Static Analysis and Ownership

Luma performs **end-of-type-check static analysis** to ensure memory safety without runtime overhead.

The analyzer checks for:

- Memory allocated but never freed  
- Double frees  
- Use-after-free errors  

It doesn't use lifetimes or a borrow checker ‚Äî instead, it relies on **explicit ownership annotations** to clarify intent.

### Example

```luma
#returns_ownership 
pub const calloc = fn (count: int, size: int) *void {
    let total_size: int = count * size;
    let ptr: *void = alloc(total_size);
 
    if (ptr != cast<*void>(0)) {
        memzero(ptr, total_size);
    }
 
    return ptr;
}

#takes_ownership 
pub const destroy_buffer = fn (buf: *byte) void {
    free(buf);
}

pub const main = fn() int {
    let buf = calloc(128, 1);
    defer destroy_buffer(buf);

    // Safe - verified at compile time in 51ms
    return 0;
}
```

**Key Features:**

- `#returns_ownership` ‚Äî Function returns newly allocated memory
- `#takes_ownership` ‚Äî Function takes responsibility for freeing memory
- `defer` ‚Äî Ensures cleanup happens at scope exit
- **Compile-time verification** ‚Äî All memory safety checks happen during type checking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following tools installed:

- **[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)** - Build automation
- **[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)** - GNU Compiler Collection
- **[LLVM](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)** - Compiler infrastructure (**Version 20.0+ required**)
- **[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/)** *(optional)* - Memory debugging

### LLVM Version Requirements

**Important:** Luma requires LLVM 20.0 or higher due to critical bug fixes in the constant generation system.

**Known Issues:**

- **LLVM 19.1.x**: Contains a regression that causes crashes during code generation (`illegal hardware instruction` errors)
- **LLVM 18.x and older**: Not tested, may have compatibility issues

If you encounter crashes during the "LLVM IR" compilation stage (typically at 60% progress), this is likely due to an incompatible LLVM version.

#### Checking Your LLVM Version

```bash
llvm-config --version
```

#### Linux Install

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S llvm
# For development headers:
sudo pacman -S llvm-libs
```

**Fedora/RHEL:**

```bash
sudo dnf update llvm llvm-devel llvm-libs
# Or install specific version:
sudo dnf install llvm20-devel llvm20-libs
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install llvm-20-dev
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install llvm
```

### Common Issues

**"illegal hardware instruction" during compilation:**

- This indicates an LLVM version incompatibility
- Upgrade to LLVM 20.0+ to resolve this issue
- See [LLVM Version Requirements](#llvm-version-requirements) above

**Missing LLVM development headers:**

```bash
# Install development packages
sudo dnf install llvm-devel        # Fedora/RHEL
sudo apt install llvm-dev          # Ubuntu/Debian
```

## Building LLVM on Windows

### Windows Prerequisites

Install the required tools using Scoop:

```bash
# Install Scoop package manager first if you haven't: https://scoop.sh/
scoop install python ninja cmake mingw
```

### Build Steps

1. Clone the LLVM repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project
```

2. Configure the build:

```bash
cmake -S llvm -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;lld" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DCMAKE_ASM_COMPILER=gcc
```

3. Build LLVM (adjust `-j8` based on your CPU cores):

```bash
ninja -C build -j8
```

### Notes

- Build time: 30 minutes to several hours depending on hardware
- Disk space required: ~15-20 GB for full build
- RAM usage: Can use 8+ GB during compilation
- If you encounter memory issues, reduce parallelism: `ninja -C build -j4` or `ninja -C build -j1`

### After Build

The compiled binaries will be located in `build/bin/`

#### Add to PATH (Optional but Recommended)

To use `clang`, `lld`, and other LLVM tools from anywhere, add the build directory to your PATH:

##### Option 1: Temporary (current session only)

```cmd
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\path\to\your\llvm-project\build\bin
```

##### Option 2: Permanent

1. Open System Properties ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Edit the `PATH` variable for your user or system
3. Add the full path to your `build\bin` directory (e.g., `C:\Users\yourname\Desktop\llvm-project\build\bin`)

##### Option 3: Using PowerShell (permanent)

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $env:PATH + ";C:\path\to\your\llvm-project\build\bin", "User")
```

#### Verify Installation

After adding to PATH, open a new command prompt and test:

```bash
clang --version
lld --version
llvm-config --version
```

---

### Examples

#### Hello World

```luma
@module "main"

pub const main = fn () int {
    output("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
$ luma hello.lx
[========================================] 100% - Completed (15ms)
Build succeeded! Written to 'output' (15ms)

$ ./output
Hello, World!
```

#### 3D Graphics (Real Example)

See [tests/3d_spinning_cube.lx](tests/3d_spinning_cube.lx) for a complete 3D graphics application that:

- Renders rotating 3D cubes
- Uses sine/cosine lookup tables for performance
- Manages memory safely with `defer`
- Compiles in **51ms** to a **24KB** binary
