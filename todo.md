## üß† Static Memory Analysis

### ‚úÖ Currently Implemented
- [x] Basic allocation/free tracking by variable name
- [x] Memory leak detection (allocated but never freed)
- [x] Double-free detection with count tracking
- [x] Integration with `defer` statements
- [x] Detailed error reporting with source locations
- [x] Anonymous allocation filtering

### üîß Memory Analysis Improvements Needed

#### High Priority
- [ ] **Pointer aliasing detection**
- [ ] Track when `ptr2 = ptr1` creates aliases
- [ ] Warn when analyzer can't track aliased pointers
- [ ] Consider ownership transfer semantics

#### Control Flow Analysis  
- [ ] **Conditional path tracking**
- [ ] Detect leaks in conditional branches (`if/else` without free in all paths)
- [ ] Handle early returns and breaks
- [ ] Track memory across loop iterations

#### Function Call Analysis
- [ ] **Cross-function tracking**
- [ ] Track pointers passed to functions as parameters
- [ ] Handle functions that free parameters
- [ ] Return value allocation tracking
- [ ] Support for ownership transfer through function calls

#### Advanced Pointer Operations
- [ ] **Complex pointer arithmetic**
- [ ] Handle `ptr + offset` operations
- [ ] Track array element allocations
- [ ] Detect out-of-bounds access potential

#### Memory Operation Extensions
- [ ] **Additional memory functions**
- [ ] Track `realloc()` operations
- [ ] Handle `calloc()` and `malloc()` variants
- [ ] Monitor `memcpy()` for potential use-after-free

#### Data Structure Tracking
- [ ] **Struct/array memory management**
- [ ] Track allocations within struct members
- [ ] Handle nested pointer structures
- [ ] Monitor array of pointers

#### Use-After-Free Detection
- [ ] **Access after free tracking**
- [ ] Detect reads/writes to freed pointers
- [ ] Track freed pointer usage across scopes
- [ ] Integration with dereference operations

#### Scope and Lifetime Analysis
- [ ] **Advanced scope tracking**
- [ ] Detect pointers escaping local scope
- [ ] Handle static/global pointer lifetimes
- [ ] Stack vs heap allocation analysis

## üìù Next Steps

### Parsing
- [ ] Add parsing for templates (`fn[T]`, `struct[T]`)  
- [ ] Add parsing for type aliases using `type` keyword  
- [ ] Add parsing for modules and imports refinements  
- [ ] Design and implement **union syntax**
- [ ] Consider Go/Odin-style loop syntax improvements

### Semantic Analysis
- [ ] Type inference for generics  
- [ ] Detect unused imports and symbols  

### Codegen
- [ ] Implement codegen for `switch` or `match` constructs  
- [ ] Support more LLVM optimizations  
- [ ] **Add structs and enums support** in codegen  
- [ ] **Add unions support** in codegen
- [ ] **Add in memcpy and streq** streq === strcmp

### Lexer & Parser
- [ ] Add tokens and grammar for unions  

### Type Checker
- [ ] Implement type checking for structs  
- [ ] Implement type checking for unions

## üöÄ Future Features Ideas (Maybe)
- [ ] Investigate pattern matching  
- [ ] Build minimal standard library
- [ ] Consider ownership/borrowing system for advanced memory safety
- [ ] Explore compile-time memory layout optimization
